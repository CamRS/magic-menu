I can see the issue in the code. The update button is being disabled by a condition that's checking for form validity, but it looks like something's preventing the form from being considered valid.
Let's examine the specific issue in the update functionality:

In HomePage.tsx (from paste.txt), the update button is disabled with this condition:
javascriptCopydisabled={createMutation.isPending || updateMutation.isPending || !form.formState.isValid}


The !form.formState.isValid is likely why the button stays grayed out. Let's fix this:Form Validation FixClick to open codeTap to openAfter reviewing the code files, I've identified several issues that could be causing the Update Item button to remain disabled. Here's a comprehensive fix:Complete Form Validation FixesClick to open codeTap to openLet me explain what's causing the Update Item button to be grayed out and how to fix it:
The Main Issue
The primary problem is in your HomePage.tsx file where the button has a condition preventing it from being enabled:
javascriptCopydisabled={createMutation.isPending || updateMutation.isPending || !form.formState.isValid}
The !form.formState.isValid check is likely what's keeping your button disabled. This happens when there are validation errors in the form that might not be visible, especially when editing an existing item.
How to Fix It

Remove the form validity check from the button:
javascriptCopydisabled={createMutation.isPending || updateMutation.isPending}
This allows users to submit the form even if the validation state isn't perfect, and then proper error messages can show up.
Ensure proper data formatting when editing an item:

In the useEffect for editingItem, make sure all values are correctly formatted
Special attention to the price field which may need explicit type conversion
Ensure customTags is always an array (even if null or undefined in the original data)


Format data properly in the handleSubmit function:

Make sure price is properly formatted
Handle any potential missing or null values



Additional Troubleshooting
If removing the form validity check doesn't solve the issue:

Check for console errors:

Open your browser developer tools
Look for any validation errors in the console that might indicate why the form is invalid


Verify form data using console.log:

Add console.log(form.formState) to see what validation errors exist
Add console.log(form.getValues()) to see current form values


Check for required fields:

Ensure all required fields defined in insertMenuItemSchema are properly populated when editing an item



By making these changes, especially removing the form validity check from the button's disabled condition, you should be able to click "Update Item" and submit your edits.
